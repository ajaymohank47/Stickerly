   ```
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_your_actual_token_here
   ```
4. This enables REAL photo-to-kawaii transformation!

### Option 2: Use Current Enhanced Version

- 👁️ Better eye enhancement and cartoon effects

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Upload a photo** in the web interface
2. **Click "Make Kawaii Sticker"**
3. **Wait for generation** (may take 10-30 seconds)
4. **Download your kawaii sticker!**

## 🎨 What You'll Get

The app creates kawaii stickers with:
- 😤 **Annoyed expression** (as requested)
- 👁️ **Big sparkling eyes** with highlights

## 🔍 If Still Having Issues
